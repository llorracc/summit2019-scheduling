# Econ-ARK

## VISION & MISSION
**Vision** 

Economists, policymakers, and other analysts should have a common framework for describing the complete economic content of dynamic models.  The quantitative conclusions from such models should be reproducible at will using an open-source toolkit so that any user can readily see how conclusions change when the model structure or calibration changes.
 
**Mission**

We are building an open source toolkit capable of solving a variety of benchmark models using modular, interoperable tools that should be easy to understand and extend.  

We are developing a modeling language that can fully describe a large fraction of models in heterogeneous agent macroeconomics or structural microceonomics.  

## PRIORITY AREAS
Areas of focus based on Vision & Mission or groups of related goals  

1. Reproduce the results of a set of canonical papers in structural microeconomics and heterogeneous agent macroeconomics
1. Build general-purpose, easily adapted versions of numerical/computational tools that have been used in specific contexts to solve specific difficult problems, but could be applied much more generally
1. Extend the modeling language syntax to allow it to represent important classes of problems that have previously been described on an ad-hoc way

## GOALS

1. Use of Econ-ARK tools to produce substantially all of the results in original (new) academic papers
1. Use of Econ-ARK tools to reproduce the results of a wide range of widely cited papers
1. Incorporation of Econ-ARK tools into models regularly used by economic policymakers
1. Adoption of Econ-ARK as a platform for teaching computational methods to PhD students


## VALUES

1. Differences in the quantitative results of economic modeling should be easy to understand as resulting from differences in calibration, structure, or data
1. Researchers should not have to spend their limited time reinventing or reverse-engineering algorithms from each other's papers
1. Microeconomic policymakers and regulators should have a framework in which costs and benefits of alternative policies can be explicitly calculated
1. Macroeconomic policymakers should be able to intelligently think about how macroeconomic outcomes result from, and affect, microeconomic foundations
