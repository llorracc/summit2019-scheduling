# 2019 Summit scheduling

This repository is meant to capture ideas/preparation for Summit sessions and unconference ideas.

For each unconference topic you plan to organize, please open a new issue in this repo. 

**UNCONFERENCE SESSION SCHEDULING:**  

We will be using post-its on top of a large sheet with the unconference schedule to plan and organize sessions.  

Please check to ensure that the session you have proposed is written on a post-it and has a spot on the schedule that will work for you. (NumFOCUS staff have written all open issue topics on post-its and placed them in suggested spots on the schedule; feel free to move them around if you are the session proposer.)

Feel free to add more post-its with new session topics!  

Please be sure to **write your name** on the post-it so that folks know who has proposed/will facilitate the session.
